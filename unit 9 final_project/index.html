        <p>The Ramones are the godfathers of punk rock. Four friends from Forest Hills, Queens in New York formed a band in 1974 and changed music forever. Members Joey, Dee Dee, Johnny, and Tommy (who eventually turned his drums over to Marky) styled themselves like 1950s greasers and adopted the last name of an alias once used by Paul McCartney from The Beatles. They hit the stage with fast, loud, and funny songs that wowed crowds at New York clubs like CBGBs and MAXs Kansas City during the early punk years. The band played hits like Blitzkrieg Bop, The KKK Took My Baby Away, and I Wanna Be Sedated for music lovers that were not exactly feeling the groove of disco or the resonating vibes of Framptonesque Arena Rock both of which were on the rise. Dedicated fans, past and present, appreciate the sheer volume of the music, the humor that only The Ramones could bring to the stage and song writing, and the serious backlog of tunes that make fans laugh at the insanity of society and themselves.</p>

                    <h3>End of the Century</h3>
                    <p>The Ramones punk rock anthem, Let's Go can be found on this classic record which was released in 1980. It's the band's 5th album and also became the title of a much beloved documentary about the band that was released in 2003.</p>

                    <h3>Too Tough to Die</h3>
                    <p>The silhouetted image of The Ramones on the cover was caused by (of all things), a camera malfunction. Dysfunction as a motivation for making art seems to define this memorable album. Vocalist Joey Ramone gets melodic on the hit Howling at the Moon (Sha-La-La). His inner crooner really shines. </p>

                    <h3>Acid Eaters</h3>
                    <p>Psychedelic imagery represents the Ramones 20th studio album. They went way (the bleep), out there. The album is comprised of cover songs. It basically shows every would be punk rock cover band how to take non-punk songs and convert them into raw forms. The Ramones version of Jefferson Airplanes hippy mantra Want Somebody to Love is fast and hilarious.</p>
