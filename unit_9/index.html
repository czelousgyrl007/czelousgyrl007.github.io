    <h> The Ramones: 1974 thru 1996 </h>
        <p>
The Ramones was an early punk rock band that was born in the Queens, New York neighborhood of Forest Hills in 1974. Original members, Joey (vocalist); Johnny (guitarist); Dee Dee (bassist); and Tommy (drummer) were known for producing short and loud songs that often contained humorous messages. The band played alongside legendary punk and proto-punk bands like Blondie, Television, and The Talking Heads in legendary New York City nightclubs like CBGBs.

<br>
The band's self-titled debut album, released in 1976, is considered a classic of the punk genre. It became the standard for delivering raw, driving songs filled with rabid energy. The Ramones released 21 live and studio albums and influenced bands like The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Green Day, and The Offspring. Any would be punk guitarist should know at least 5 Ramones songs.
